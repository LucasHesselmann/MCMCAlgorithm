\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}


Some general introduction to Monte Carlo methods and MCMC methods.

What are Monte Carlo and MCMC methods? What is the aim? What are the applications? A brief history? (Short comparison between numerical and stochastic methods? Advantages and disadvantages?)

1946, Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico, U.S.A.. Mathematicians: John von Neumann, Stanislaw Ulam, Robert Richtmyer, Physicists: Enrico Fermi, Nick Metropolis, Edward Teller.
Invention of first electronic computers as ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) made it possible to simulate (Monte Carlo Simulation).

\subsection*{Statement of the problem}

Look at computational cost of MCMC methods as a function of dimension $ N $.

Optimal Scaling for RWM and MALA.
